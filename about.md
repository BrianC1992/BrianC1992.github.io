## Brian Cocolicchio

 I am a statistician/data scientist currently working as an adjunct instructor in the Science Department at Rockland Community College where I teach Chemistry, Engineering, Math and Physics. When I worked in industry I was a Six Sigma Black Belt and quality engineer in the pharmaceutical, health care and medical device industries. Previous to that I worked as an R & D Engineer in the aerospace and fuel cell industries.  I have a BS in Chemical Engineering and MS degrees in Industrial Chemistry and Applied Statistics.

## Statistics/Data Science Interests

I am interested in applications of data science to sports, business process improvement, marketing, education, risk (financial or otherwise), and manufacturing. 

## Mean Square Senpai?

The mean square is used in ANOVA, Regression and Statistical Design of Experiments. It is an estimate of a population variance. A senpai (pronounced: SEM-PIE) in Japanese culture is regarded as a senior student. In terms of my journey in the field, the term senpai fits in more ways than one.
